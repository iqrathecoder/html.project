<h3>Silver Linings Playbook (2012)
</h3>
<p>Bradley Cooper’s Pat Solitano Jr. is a man who wants to see the silver linings in life. That’s not so easy in Silver Linings Playbook, since Pat just got out of the mental hospital after an eight-month stint that was set off when he caught his wife, Nikki (Brea Bee), with another man. The only thing Pat wants is to rebuild his life and win Nikki back.</p>
<h3>Get Out (2017)
    </h3>
<p>The title of the film is uttered by the only other Black man there, Logan King (LaKeith Stanfield), when he briefly attacks Chris. And it’s only later that Chris realizes that “get out” wasn’t said out of anger. It was a warning, and it may already be too late for Chris.</p>
<h3>Fair Play </h3>
<p>Luke (Alden Ehrenreich) and Emily (Phoebe Dynevor) are secret lovers who work for a hedge fund in Fair Play. Their relationship is against company policy, which is why they’ve hidden it. However, their storybook romance starts to shatter when Luke believes that he’s getting a promotion that ultimately goes to Emily.</p>
